** CONTENTS   
*****************

This directory contains everything necessary to produce the above output.

There are a number of sub-directories:

 distribution: LOOK HERE FOR R CODE and DATA
 diff    : check original run output with distribution version
 original: the original output

In the 'distribution' subdirectory:

  abseday.FL2000.csv : raw data
  abseday2.R         : load data and produce z measures
  abseday.plot2.R    : plot figure

*****************
** HOW-TO 
*****************

In the 'distribution' subdirectory, order of running files matters!

This must be run first:

  R BATCH abseday2.R

which creates output AND .RData file.

This .RData file is necessary for running 

  R BATCH abseday.plot2.R
